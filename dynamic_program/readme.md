The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial. 

Concept of dynamic problem is divided into two parts
1. Overlapping sub problem -> Identify the overlapping issues in problem.
2. Optimal sub structure ---> Find the optimal solution for a problem.
